Guide: Building a Serverless Web App for Audio Trimming

Web App Introduction:

This web application allows users to upload any audio file and trims it into smaller segments of exactly 2 minutes each. For instance, if a user uploads a 10-minute audio file, the application will divide it into five separate 2-minute parts. All operations occur locally in the user’s browser, ensuring that no files are uploaded to a server, maintaining privacy, and reducing latency. After the trimming process, users can download the smaller audio segments directly to their device.

Features:
	1.	Audio Upload: Users can select an audio file in common formats like MP3, WAV, or OGG.
	2.	Processing in Browser: The audio file is processed in the user’s browser using the Web Audio API to split it into chunks.
	3.	Downloadable Segments: Each 2-minute audio segment is made available for download in the same format as the original file.
	4.	Completely Serverless: The entire workflow (upload, processing, and download) occurs in the browser without reliance on a backend.
	5.	Responsive UI: Works on desktop and mobile devices with a clean, user-friendly interface.

Detailed Workflow:
	1.	File Upload:
	•	Users upload an audio file using a simple file input.
	•	The file is read locally and decoded into a usable audio format.
	2.	Audio Decoding:
	•	The Web Audio API is used to decode the audio file into an AudioBuffer, which provides access to the audio’s raw data.
	3.	Trimming Logic:
	•	The total duration of the audio is determined.
	•	The app calculates the number of 2-minute segments needed and extracts chunks of audio data accordingly.
	4.	Exporting Audio Chunks:
	•	The extracted segments are processed using an OfflineAudioContext for rendering.
	•	The processed audio data is converted into downloadable formats (e.g., WAV or MP3).
	5.	Download Functionality:
	•	Blob objects are created for each segment, and download links are dynamically generated for users to save the trimmed audio files.

Proposed Tech Stack:
	1.	Frontend:
	•	Framework: Next.js (for a modern and fast React-based UI).
	•	Styling: Tailwind CSS (for responsive and clean UI design).
	2.	Audio Processing:
	•	Web Audio API: For decoding, manipulating, and exporting audio data.
	•	JavaScript File APIs: To handle file uploads, Blob creation, and downloads.
	•	Libraries:
	•	wavefile (for exporting WAV files).
	•	libmp3lame.js (for exporting MP3 files if MP3 output is required).
	3.	Storage & Backend:
	•	No backend or storage required: All processing happens locally in the browser, making it fully serverless.
	4.	Deployment:
	•	Netlify or Vercel: For hosting the web app with zero configuration.
	•	GitHub/GitLab: For version control and collaboration.
	5.	Browser Compatibility:
	•	Ensure support for modern browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. Test on mobile browsers for optimal performance.
	6.	Performance Optimization:
	•	Use Web Workers if necessary to offload audio processing to a separate thread, ensuring the UI remains responsive during heavy tasks.

Deliverables for the Developer:
	1.	A fully responsive web app where users can:
	•	Upload audio files.
	•	View the trimming progress.
	•	Download 2-minute segments after processing.
	2.	The web app must be serverless, with no backend dependency.
	3.	Include support for common audio formats (MP3, WAV, OGG).
	4.	Provide a simple, user-friendly interface with clear instructions for users.
	5.	Ensure smooth performance across devices, including smartphones.
